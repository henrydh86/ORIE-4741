##Background:
Airbnb is an online marketplace that enables people to list, find, and then rent vacation homes for a processing fee. The platform has brought convenience for people and has been increasingly popular as a vacation option nowadays. It not only offers more economic prices than hotels, but also allows tourists to experience life like a local. On the other hand, Airbnb provides house owners an opportunity to make a profit on their unoccupied estate. 

The Question: What price the host should set to maximize his/her profit.

##Why is the problem important?
In this project, we are trying to develop an evaluation tool based on the data in San Francisco. With such tool, an Airbnb host can quickly get an expected gain from renting his/her available housing to the customers on Airbnb platform. 
From the host’s perspective, one of the most important goal is to utilize the most availabilities of houses and to maximize profit. Therefore, answering this question can potentially motivate hosts.
For tourists, one crucial advantage of Airbnb over hotels is the price, so predicting a suitable price is essentially the same as attracting more customers. If Airbnb hosts can make a profit meeting their expectations, more and more people will join Airbnb and thus more tourists can take the advantage of cheap renting. This win-win situation is apparently ideal.

##why you think the data set will allow you to (begin to) answer the question?
The data from “Inside Airbnb” provides detailed information on the listing of accommodations, host information and historical reviews. These data contain a lot of interesting features and if we can build a model from it, then we will be able to suggest a suitable price and thus, maximizes the profit. More precisely, we want to build a model based on the data in San Francisco
